    <h2 class='aboutSubtitle'>This project is a school assignment where I try to
      replicate the popular word guessing game Wordle where the computer will
      pick a random word for you to guess! If the letter is green it means that
      its placed correctly. Yellow means misplaced and red means incorrect. With
      this information youâ€™ll have to deduct what the correct word is! Your
      score will be calculated by time spent solving the challenge, and also a
      deduction for each incorrect word guessed. Good luck!</h2>
